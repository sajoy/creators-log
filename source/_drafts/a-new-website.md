March 17 - March 23, 2019

## This week I
1. drew a recap sketch for the previous week
1. drew myself a couple times - instead of cats
1. redid my personal website!
1. deployed the Fry Tally settings update

## What I learned
- I used [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) to draw the cats - so I learned some useful hot keys like **b** for the bezier tool and **n** for the node tool.
