March 24 - March 30, 2019

## This week I
1. went on a road trip with some friends to CA
1. took a butt load of pictures
1. illustrated a venus fly trap + gummy worm

## What I learned
1. if you're going to road trip and camp, it's very very very very important to pack in an organized manner. otherwise, your car will be a f*cking mess by the end.
1. it is still cold in the mountains in March.
