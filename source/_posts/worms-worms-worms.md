March 17 - March 23, 2019

## This week I
1. drew a recap sketch for the previous week
1. drew gummy worms crawling out of/around various objects
1. practiced shading

## What I learned
- I tried a different technique for my Inkscape drawings. Before I was making one big outline then filling in details. This week I drew objects one section at a time, which made it easier to color different sections.
- I took a drawing class in college and remember shading and understanding light being the hardest part of the class. This time around it was slightly easier to grasp and I hope revisting it again and again will make it even more so.
