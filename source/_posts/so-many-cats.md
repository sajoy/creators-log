March 3 - March 9, 2019

## This week I
1. drew a recap sketch for the previous week
1. drew a cat every day Monday-Friday
1. added settings to Fry Tally to let users change the font and background colors

## What I learned
- I used [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) to draw the cats - so I learned some useful hot keys like **b** for the bezier tool and **n** for the node tool.

## Pictures
